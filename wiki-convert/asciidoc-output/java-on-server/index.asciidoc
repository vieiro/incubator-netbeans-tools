== Java EE and Web Application Development

link:../../images_www/v7/1/screenshots/web-app.png[image:web-app-cut.png[][font-11]#Click image for fullscreen preview#]

Write standards-based web and enterprise applications that can be accessed from a wide range of clients such as web browsers, mobile devices and more. Get unmatched out-of-the-box experience. With a few clicks, create Java EE 7, Java EE 6 and Java EE 5 based applications with support for all relevant Java EE technologies, while leveraging the IDE's comprehensive support for HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 development, as described on the link:../html5/index.html[HTML5 Web Development Support] page.

=== Enterprise Application Development

The NetBeans IDE provides support for the latest Java EE 7 specification. Develop components including web pages, servlets, web services, Enterprise Java Beans, JSF, JPA, and support for Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI).

=== Deploy, Debug, Monitor and Profile

You can deploy your applications to GlassFish, WebLogic, Tomcat or JBoss server. The Deploy on Save feature lets you see changes to your application immediately after you save files in the editor.

You can also place breakpoints in your Java or JSF files and debug your app, or profile it using the NetBeans profiler. There is also the HTTP Server-side monitor that enables you to diagnose problems with data flow from JSF and servlet execution on the web server.

=== Web Services Development

NetBeans IDE supports Web services standards from the newer Java EE 7 and Java EE 6 specifications and also the older Java EE 5 and earlier specification.

You can create and consume Web services using features such as wizard based code generation and in editor code insertions. The code completion functionality includes annotations that you can use in your web services.

=== Web Application Development

NetBeans IDE make it easy to create Java EE based Web application projects with either JSF 2.2 (Facelets), JSP's or Servlets. In addition, you can can create and work with Web applications using other frameworks like the Spring, Struts, and Hibernate frameworks. The editor supports code completion, navigation and refactoring for mapping files.

Furthermore, the IDE can be easily configured to work with other frameworks, by installing additional plugins, when made available, from the Update Center.

Select the Spring framework in the New Project wizard and immediately start out with a skeleton Spring Web MVC application. Take advantage of refactoring (including XML configuration files), and code completion in the editor.

[overview-centre]#image:struts.png[]#
Select the Struts framework to create flexible web applications based on standard technologies, such as JSP pages, JavaBeans, resource bundles, and XML. Benefit from code completion for Struts tags, and Struts Javadoc pop-ups in the editor.

[overview-centre]#image:hibernate-web-apps.png[]#
Hibernate libraries are automatically bundled with your application when you select the Hibernate framework in the New Project wizard. The IDE provides wizards for creating Hibernate reverse engineering and configuration XML files and POJO classes.
