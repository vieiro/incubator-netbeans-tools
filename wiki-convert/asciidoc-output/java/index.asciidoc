NetBeans IDE provides Java developers with all the tools needed to create professional desktop, mobile and enterprise applications.

    [overview-left]#link:../../images_www/v7/3/features/java-editor-full.png[image:../../images_www/v7/3/features/java-editor-cut.png[]]#

=== Creating, Editing, and Refactoring

The IDE provides wizards and templates to let you create Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME applications. A variety of technologies and frameworks are supported out of the box. For example, you can use wizard and templates to create applications that use the OSGi framework or the NetBeans module system as the basis of modular applications.

The language-aware NetBeans editor detects errors while you type and assists you with documentation popups and smart code completion—all with the speed and simplicity of your favorite lightweight text editor.

=== Building

Out of the box, the IDE provides support for the Maven and Ant build systems. In the New Project wizard, when you choose to create a new application, you can choose to create Maven-based or Ant-based applications.

You can open Maven-based applications into the IDE without an import process because the IDE reads project settings from the Maven POM file. In addition, tools are provided for importing Ant-based projects that were not created in the IDE.

The IDE includes a Maven Repository Browser, as well as graphs for analying Maven dependencies.

=== Debugging and Profiling

To identify and solve problems in your applications, such as deadlocks and memory leaks, the IDE provides a feature rich debugger and profiler.

=== Testing and Code Analysis

When you are testing your applications, the IDE provides tools for using JUnit and TestNG, as well as code analyzers and, in particular, integration with the popular open source FindBugs tool.
