=== Web Frameworks

NetBeans IDE supports the following popular web frameworks:

* link:http://framework.zend.com/[Zend Framework] (link:http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/zend-framework-screencast.html[screencast])
* link:http://symfony.com/[Symfony2 Framework]
* link:http://symfony.com/legacy[Symfony1 Framework] (link:http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/symfony-screencast.html[screencast])

In general, you can create new PHP projects with these frameworks, run framework commands, navigate from controller (action) to its view, use framework annotations and code-completion in the editor and customize its settings.

=== Documenting PHP Code with ApiGen

You can use NetBeans PHP IDE to generate PHP code documentation with link:http://apigen.org/[ApiGen]. You must download ApiGen yourself and make certain in the IDE Options that the IDE recognizes the ApiGen installation and that the IDE has found the correct path to the ApiGen script. After you set everything up correctly, all you have to do is right-click a project node and select Generate Documentation. The IDE generates the documentation files in the location of your choice.
