=== How do I add an action to a the popup menu of the Java editor?

The simplest way is to run New Action Wizard (File > New... > Module Development > Action) which creates an action for you and registers it in your `layer.xml`.

1. On the first tab, choose *Conditionally Enabled* action and select `EditorCookie` as the cookie class. 
2. On the second tab, check *Editor Context Menu Item* and choose MIME type (`text/x-java` in this case) and position.

OR
use

[source,java]
----

@ActionReference(path="Editors/text/x-java/Popup")
----

 for an action with the `EditorCookie` as context object
