Rails is no longer available in the standard NetBeans IDE build. Please

      <h2>Ruby Source Code Editor</h2>
      <p> The editor indents, completes, and highlights your Ruby code
syntactically as well as semantically. It assists you with rename
refactoring, type inference, and navigation. The editor parses your
code live as you type, so it can match words and brackets, mark errors
and occurrences, and display new quick fixes and RDoc. With a few
keystrokes you insert commonly used code snippets from live templates. </p>

      <h2>Ruby Projects</h2>
      <p> The Ruby project type supports Ruby files, RSpec
specification files, and YAML files. Use the Ruby Platform manager to
choose between executing projects using JRuby, or any other native Ruby
interpreter on your system. </p>
      <p> The IDE has Rake build tool integration and gives you access
to the Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB). Refactoring and support for
Test::Unit, Auto Test, Shoulda tests, and RSpec are well integrated.
You can also track hints and errors in the task list. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Ruby on Rails Projects</h2>
      <p> The Ruby on Rails project type supports Rake targets and
database migrations. The Rake Runner dialog keeps a list of the
previously entered parameters and automatically populates the list of
parameters for migrate and fixtures tasks. You can generate Rails 3
projects, or generate code through the Rails code generator graphical
wizard. The logical project view clearly separates controllers from
models, views, and database migrations. </p>
      <p> Edit ERB files and deploy projects directly to the WEBrick
and Mongrel web servers. You can jump quickly between a Rails action
and its corresponding view, and warp to the browser for the URL most
relevant to the file you are editing. </p>
      <h2>Ruby and Rails Debugger</h2>
      <p> Single-step or run through Ruby code and ERB files. Set
breakpoints, look at local variables, navigate the call stack, switch
threads. Hover the mouse over a variable in the Editor to evaluate the
expressions and show it in a tooltip. The NetBeans IDE supports the
Fast Ruby Debugger, which also works with JRuby. You can debug Ruby
files that are not part of a NetBeans project, or attach the debugger
to any remote process started from the command line, and get all the
advantages of a user-friendly debugger frontend. </p>

      <h2>Ruby Gems Installation Manager</h2>
      <p> Extend your Ruby installation using the integrated Ruby Gems
packaging system. You can configure $GEM_PATH or $GEM_HOME using the
Gems installation manager. Add and manage freely available Ruby
software libraries, and distribute your own packages. The Gem Manager
even allows you to uninstall a certain version of a gem. </p>
      <p>If you install the Bundler gem, you can run Bundler actions
from the project context menu.</p>
