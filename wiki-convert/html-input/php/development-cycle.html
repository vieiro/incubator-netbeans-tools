<p class="intro">When you are testing your application, the IDE provides tools for using PHPUnit, generates report of code coverage and more.</p>

        <h2>PHP Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>Create <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/">PHPUnit</a> tests and Selenium test cases for
            files or folders, run tests, and view test results. You can define test groups to selectively run unit test upon. In the PHPUnit properties
            you can define a custom XML configuration file, a bootstrap file for command line options, or a custom test suite, or project-specific
            PHPUnit script. You can let the IDE generate skeleton code for you using
            <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/skeleton-generator.html">PHPUnit Skeleton Generator</a>. Use a keyboard shortcut
            to navigate quickly between test and tested class.<br>

        <h2>Code Coverage</h2>
        <p>Generate a Code Coverage report for PHP files to see how well your test cases cover your code:
            Covered statements are marked green in the editor, statements that haven't been executed during the test are marked red.
            The evaluation is based on the number of executable statements, lines with white space and comments do not distort the result.</p>

        <h2>Continuous Integration Support</h2>
        <p>NetBeans IDE supports continuous integration. Continuous integration is a software development
            practice involving version control and a specialized server. The specialized server runs scheduled PHPUnit and Code Coverage tests
            on the software. Test results are associated with version control information, so developers can identify bugs they introduce to
            the software quickly and easily. NetBeans uses <a href="http://jenkins-php.org/">Template for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects</a>,
            which must be set up with the necessary plugins and tools on the integration server.</p>
