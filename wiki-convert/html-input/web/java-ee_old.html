      <h2>Full Support for Java Enterprise Edition 6</h2>
      <p> The NetBeans IDE provides complete support for
the latest Java EE 6 standards, including JSF 2.1 (Facelets), Java
Persistence 2.0 and Contexts and Dependency Injection 1.0, as well as
the Java EE 5, and J2EE 1.4 platforms. Use NetBeans IDE for
development with the Java Persistence API, servlets, JavaServer Pages
(JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB 3.1), <a href="web-services.html">web
services</a> and other Java EE
technologies.<br>
      <a class="notes"
 href="../../kb/docs/javaee/javaee-gettingstarted.html">Getting Started
with Java EE 6 Applications</a> </p>
      <h2>Contexts and Dependency Injection (JSR 299)&nbsp;<img
 alt="improved!" src="../../images_www/v6/features/improved_small.gif"></h2>
      <p> Use the New Project wizard or new File wizard to create files
that are ready for Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). CDI allows
Java EE components such as servlets, enterprise beans, and JavaBeans to
exist within the lifecycle of an application with well-defined scopes.
Right-click any injection point to trigger Go To Injectables and
Inspect Injectables menu actions. <br>

      <h2>Server Deployment</h2>
      <p> The IDE works with any standard Java Enterprise Edition (Java
EE) container, and was tested with GlassFish Server Open Source Edition
3.1.2, WebLogic 12c and 11g, Apache Tomcat 7.0 and 6.0, JBoss 6.1, and
others.</p>
      
      <h2>JSF 2.0 Development</h2>
      <p> NetBeans IDE supports Facelets, the official view
technology for JSF 2.1. You can create a new web application project
based on the Facelets framework and work with standard JSF reference
implementation components. This includes a comprehensive library of
JavaServer Faces components such as Table, Calendar, Tree, Tab Set,
File Upload, and more. </p>
      <p> The IDE includes an editor for deployment descriptors
(web.xml files) and an HTTP monitor for tracking and debugging the data
flow between components of a web application. 
The IDE also supports various JSF component libraries (PrimeFaces, RichFaces, ICEfaces)
that can simplify the development of facelet pages.<br>
      <a class="notes" href="../../kb/docs/web/jsf20-intro.html">Introduction
to JavaServer Faces 2.0</a> </p>
      
      <h2>JSF Code Generation and Palettes</h2>
      <p> Use the JSF CRUD application generator
(Create/Read/Update/Delete) to create a complete functional JSF page
for manipulating data from a database. The New File wizard can generate
customizable CRUD JSF pages from existing entities. </p>
      <p> Use the customizable HTML and JSF components palettes to drag
and drop HTML and JSF forms into web pages and to generate JSF
data tables from entities. The IDE now generates code using annotations
instead of deployment descriptors where possible. </p>
      <h2>Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) Development</h2>
      <p> The IDE supports EJB 3.1 in web application projects. 
The EJB project file wizard provides options for creating Singleton session beans
as well as Timer session beans for working with timed notifications.
You can use a wizard to easily create a Session Bean for an entity class including
the appropriate annotations and commonly used default methods.
Beans can be exposed with a local interface or a no-interface view. <br>

 href="../../kb/docs/javaee/javaee-entapp-ejb.html">Creating an
Enterprise Application with EJB 3.1</a> </p>
      <h2>Java Persistence</h2>
      <p> The IDE provides tools to work with the Java Persistence API
2.0. Wizards enable you to generate entity classes from a database, and
a JavaServer Faces CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) application
from entity classes. The IDE supports all types of entity relationships
(one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many) and all types
of primary keys (single-column, composite, and generated). The IDE also
provides templates and graphic editors for creating and maintaining
persistence units. </p>
      <h2>JavaServer Pages (JSP) Development</h2>
      <p> In JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, the editor assists you with
code completion, hypertext navigation, error checking, and debugging.
You can also leverage the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL).
      </p>
      <h2>Deploy on Save</h2>
      <p> The IDE instantly redeploys any running Java EE application
when a change is made to the project. Deploy on Save is available for
web, EJB and EAR applications, and supported for GlassFish 3.x,
WebLogic and Tomcat (directory-based deployment is prerequisite).</p>
